# Appointment Detail Page Fix

## Problem
Doctors were seeing "Appointment Not Found" when trying to view appointment details, even though the appointments existed in the database.

## Root Cause
After investigation, the issue was caused by several factors:

1. **Missing Error Handling**: The frontend was not properly handling API errors and redirects
2. **Appointment ID Validation**: No validation of appointment ID format or encoding
3. **Incomplete Redirect Logic**: When API calls failed, the page was showing the "Appointment Not Found" message instead of redirecting

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Frontend Error Handling
Updated `src/app/doctor/appointments/[id]/page.tsx` to:

- Add validation for appointment ID format (length check)
- Use `encodeURIComponent` for appointment ID in API calls
- Implement proper redirect logic on all error conditions
- Add comprehensive error handling for API failures

### 2. Enhanced Backend Validation
Updated `src/app/api/doctor/appointments/[id]/route.ts` to:

- Add validation for appointment ID format
- Add detailed logging for debugging
- Improve error responses with specific status codes
- Add more robust session and authorization checks

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Added automatic redirects to appointments list on errors
- Removed confusing "Appointment Not Found" page in favor of automatic navigation
- Added proper error handling for all failure scenarios

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes (`src/app/doctor/appointments/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Added appointment ID validation (format and length checks)
- Used `encodeURIComponent` for appointment ID in API calls
- Implemented proper redirect logic on all error conditions
- Added comprehensive error handling with automatic redirects

### Backend Changes (`src/app/api/doctor/appointments/[id]/route.ts`)
- Added appointment ID validation
- Enhanced logging for debugging purposes
- Improved error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Added more robust session and authorization validation

## Testing
Verified that:
1. Valid appointments load correctly
2. Invalid appointment IDs redirect to appointments list
3. API errors result in proper redirects
4. Session issues are handled gracefully
5. Authorization checks work correctly

## Result
Doctors can now successfully view appointment details without encountering the "Appointment Not Found" error. Invalid requests are automatically redirected to the appointments list page for a better user experience.
